# Controlling Which Auto Scaling Instances Terminate During Scale In<a name="as-instance-termination"></a>

With each Auto Scaling group, you control when it adds instances \(referred to as *scaling out*\) or remove instances \(referred to as *scaling in*\) from your network architecture\. You can scale the size of your group manually by attaching and detaching instances, or you can automate the process through the use of a scaling policy\.

When you configure automatic scale in, you must decide which instances should terminate first and set up a termination policy\.

You can also use instance protection to prevent specific instances from being terminated during automatic scale in\.

## Default Termination Policy<a name="default-termination-policy"></a>

The default termination policy is designed to help ensure that your network architecture spans Availability Zones evenly\. With the default termination policy, the behavior of the Auto Scaling group is as follows:

1. If there are instances in multiple Availability Zones, select the Availability Zone with the most instances and at least one instance that is not protected from scale in\. If there is more than one Availability Zone with this number of instances, select the Availability Zone with the instances that use the oldest launch configuration\.

1. Determine which unprotected instances in the selected Availability Zone use the oldest launch configuration\. If there is one such instance, terminate it\.

1. If there are multiple instances that use the oldest launch configuration, determine which unprotected instances are closest to the next billing hour\. \(This helps you maximize the use of your EC2 instances and manage your Amazon EC2 usage costs\.\) If there is one such instance, terminate it\.

1. If there is more than one unprotected instance closest to the next billing hour, select one of these instances at random\.

The following flow diagram illustrates how the default termination policy works\.

![\[A flowchart showing how an Auto Scaling group uses the default termination policy to terminate instances.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/termination-policy-default-flowchart-diagram.png)

Consider an Auto Scaling group that has two Availability Zones, a desired capacity of two instances, and scaling policies that increase and decrease the number of instances by 1 when certain thresholds are met\. The two instances in this group are distributed as follows\.

![\[A basic Auto Scaling group.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/termination-policy-default-diagram.png)

When the threshold for the scale\-out policy is met, the policy takes effect and the Auto Scaling group launches a new instance\. The Auto Scaling group now has three instances, distributed as follows\.

![\[An Auto Scaling group after a scaling action occurs.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/termination-policy-default-2-diagram.png)

When the threshold for the scale\-in policy is met, the policy takes effect and the Auto Scaling group terminates one of the instances\. If you did not assign a specific termination policy to the group, it uses the default termination policy\. It selects the Availability Zone with two instances, and terminates the instance launched from the oldest launch configuration\. If the instances were launched from the same launch configuration, then the Auto Scaling group selects the instance that is closest to the next billing hour and terminates it\.

## Customizing the Termination Policy<a name="custom-termination-policy"></a>

The default termination policy assigned to an Auto Scaling group is typically sufficient for most situations\. However, you have the option of replacing the default policy with a customized one\.

When you customize the termination policy, if one Availability Zone has more instances than the other Availability Zones that are used by the group, then your termination policy is applied to the instances from the imbalanced Availability Zone\. If the Availability Zones used by the group are balanced, then the termination policy is applied across all the Availability Zones for the group\.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports the following custom termination policies:
+ `OldestInstance`\. Terminate the oldest instance in the group\. This option is useful when you're upgrading the instances in the Auto Scaling group to a new EC2 instance type\. You can gradually replace instances of the old type with instances of the new type\.
+ `NewestInstance`\. Terminate the newest instance in the group\. This policy is useful when you're testing a new launch configuration but don't want to keep it in production\.
+ `OldestLaunchConfiguration`\. Terminate instances that have the oldest launch configuration\. This policy is useful when you're updating a group and phasing out the instances from a previous configuration\.
+ `ClosestToNextInstanceHour`\. Terminate instances that are closest to the next billing hour\. This policy helps you maximize the use of your instances and manage your Amazon EC2 usage costs\.
+ `Default`\. Terminate instances according to the default termination policy\. This policy is useful when you have more than one scaling policy for the group\.

**To customize a termination policy using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Auto Scaling Groups**\.

1. Select the Auto Scaling group\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Edit**\.

1. On the **Details** tab, locate **Termination Policies**\. Choose one or more termination policies\. If you choose multiple policies, list them in the order that you would like them to apply\. If you use the `Default` policy, make it the last one in the list\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

**To customize a termination policy using the AWS CLI**  
Use one of the following commands:
+ [create\-auto\-scaling\-group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html)
+ [update\-auto\-scaling\-group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html)

You can use these policies individually, or combine them into a list of policies\. For example, use the following command to update an Auto Scaling group to use the `OldestLaunchConfiguration` policy first and then use the `ClosestToNextInstanceHour` policy:

```
aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --termination-policies "OldestLaunchConfiguration,ClosestToNextInstanceHour"
```

If you use the `Default` termination policy, make it the last one in the list of termination policies\. For example, `--termination-policies "OldestLaunchConfiguration,Default"`\.

## Instance Protection<a name="instance-protection"></a>

To control whether an Auto Scaling group can terminate a particular instance when scaling in, use instance protection\. You can enable the instance protection setting on an Auto Scaling group or an individual Auto Scaling instance\. When the Auto Scaling group launches an instance, it inherits the instance protection setting of the Auto Scaling group\. You can change the instance protection setting for an Auto Scaling group or an Auto Scaling instance at any time\.

Instance protection starts when the instance state is `InService`\. If you detach an instance that is protected from termination, its instance protection setting is lost\. When you attach the instance to the group again, it inherits the current instance protection setting of the group\.

If all instances in an Auto Scaling group are protected from termination during scale in and a scale in event occurs, its desired capacity is decremented\. However, the Auto Scaling group can't terminate the required number of instances until their instance protection settings are disabled\.

Instance protection does not protect Auto Scaling instances from the following:
+ Manual termination through the Amazon EC2 console, the `terminate-instances` command, or the `TerminateInstances` action\. To protect Auto Scaling instances from manual termination, enable termination protection\. For more information, see [Enabling Termination Protection](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#Using_ChangingDisableAPITermination) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ Health check replacement if the instance fails health checks\.
+ Spot Instance interruption\.
