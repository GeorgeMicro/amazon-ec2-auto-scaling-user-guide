### Troubleshooting launch template error: "You are not authorized to perform this operation"<a name="ts-launch-template-unauthorized-error"></a>

The following sections can help you troubleshoot the "You are not authorized to perform this operation" error when creating or updating Auto Scaling groups\.

#### Permissions required for a launch template are missing<a name="launch-template-permissions"></a>

If you are attempting to use a launch template, and the IAM credentials you are using do not have sufficient permissions, you receive an error that you're not authorized to use the launch template\. For information about the permissions necessary to work with launch templates, see [Launch template support](ec2-auto-scaling-launch-template-permissions.md)\.

#### Permissions required to pass an IAM role are missing<a name="ts-instance-profile-permissions"></a>

If you are attempting to use a launch template that specifies an instance profile, you must have permission to pass the IAM role that is associated with the instance profile\. For more information, see [IAM role for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances](us-iam-role.md)\. For further troubleshooting topics related to instance profiles, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 and IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_iam-ec2.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Troubleshooting instance termination<a name="ts-failed-status-checks"></a>

Amazon EC2 performs status checks on running EC2 instances to identify hardware and software issues\. If one or more checks fail, the instance returns a status of `impaired` to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which then automatically replaces it as part of its health checks\. To determine why Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminated an instance, see [Why did Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminate an instance?](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/auto-scaling-instance-how-terminated/) in the AWS Knowledge Center\.

Note that instances launched in an Auto Scaling group require sufficient warm\-up time \(grace period\) to prevent early termination due to a health check replacement\. To update the health check grace period for your Auto Scaling group to an appropriate time period for your application, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) command\. Make sure that the health check grace period is longer than the instance startup time\. Otherwise, healthy instances can be terminated before they finish starting up\.

## Retrieving an error message<a name="RetrievingErrors"></a>

To retrieve an error message from the description of scaling activities, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.html) command as follows:

```
aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
```

The following is an example response, where `StatusCode` contains the current status of the activity and `StatusMessage` contains the error message:

```
{
    "Activities": [
        {
            "Description": "Launching a new EC2 instance: i-4ba0837f",
            "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
            "ActivityId": "f9f2d65b-f1f2-43e7-b46d-d86756459699",
            "Details": "{"Availability Zone":"us-west-2c"}",
            "StartTime": "2013-08-19T20:53:29.930Z",
            "Progress": 100,
            "EndTime": "2013-08-19T20:54:02Z",
            "Cause": "At 2013-08-19T20:53:25Z a user request created an AutoScalingGroup...",
            "StatusCode": "Failed",
            "StatusMessage": "The image id 'ami-4edb0327' does not exist. Launching EC2 instance failed."
        }
   ]
}
```

The following tables list the types of error messages and provide links to the troubleshooting resources that you can use to troubleshoot issues\.
