# Attaching a Load Balancer to Your Auto Scaling Group<a name="attach-load-balancer-asg"></a>

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling integrates with Elastic Load Balancing to enable you to attach one or more load balancers to an existing Auto Scaling group\. After you attach the load balancer, it automatically registers the instances in the group and distributes incoming traffic across the instances\. To use an Elastic Load Balancing health check with your instances to ensure that traffic is routed only to the healthy instances, see [Using Elastic Load Balancing Health Checks with Auto Scaling](as-add-elb-healthcheck.md)\.

When you attach a load balancer, it enters the `Adding` state while registering the instances in the group\. After all instances in the group are registered with the load balancer, it enters the `Added` state\. After at least one registered instance passes the health checks, it enters the `InService` state\. After the load balancer enters the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy\. If no registered instances pass the health checks \(for example, due to a misconfigured health check\), the load balancer doesn't enter the `InService` state\. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't terminate and replace the instances\.

When you detach a load balancer, it enters the `Removing` state while deregistering the instances in the group\. The instances remain running after they are deregistered\. If connection draining is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in\-flight requests to complete or for the maximum timeout to expire \(whichever comes first\) before deregistering the instances\. Connection draining is always enabled for Application Load Balancers but must be enabled for Classic Load Balancers\. For more information, see [Connection Draining](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/config-conn-drain.html) in the *User Guide for Classic Load Balancers*\.

Elastic Load Balancing sends data about your load balancers and EC2 instances to Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch collects performance data for your resources and presents it as metrics\. For more information, see [Monitoring Your Auto Scaling Groups and Instances Using Amazon CloudWatch](as-instance-monitoring.md)\. After you attach a load balancer to your Auto Scaling group, you can create scaling policies that use Elastic Load Balancing metrics to scale your application automatically\. For more information, see [Create an Auto Scaling Group with Target Tracking Scaling Policies](as-scaling-target-tracking.md#policy_creating)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="as-add-load-balancer-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, create a load balancer in the same region as the Auto Scaling group\. Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers\. You can attach any of these types of load balancers to your Auto Scaling group\. For more information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/)\.

With Classic Load Balancers, instances are registered with the load balancer\. With Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, instances are registered as targets with a target group\. When you plan to use your load balancer with an Auto Scaling group, you don't need to register your EC2 instances with the load balancer or target group\. After you attach a load balancer or target group to your Auto Scaling group, the group registers your instances with the load balancer or target group when it launches them\.

## Add a Load Balancer Using the Console<a name="as-add-load-balancer-console"></a>

Use the following procedure to attach a load balancer to an existing Auto Scaling group\. To attach your load balancer to your Auto Scaling group when you create the group, see [Tutorial: Set Up a Scaled and Load\-Balanced Application](as-register-lbs-with-asg.md)\.

**To attach a load balancer to a group**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choose **Auto Scaling Groups**\.

1. Select your group\.

1. On the **Details** tab, choose **Edit**\.

1. Do one of the following:

   1. \[Classic Load Balancers\] For **Load Balancers**, select your load balancer\.

   1. \[Target groups\] For **Target Groups**, select your target group\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

When you no longer need the load balancer, use the following procedure to detach it from your Auto Scaling group\.

**To detach a load balancer from a group**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choose **Auto Scaling Groups**\.

1. Select your group\.

1. On the **Details** tab, choose **Edit**\.

1. Do one of the following:

   1. \[Classic Load Balancers\] For **Load Balancers**, remove the load balancer\.

   1. \[Target groups\] For **Target Groups**, remove the target group\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Add a Load Balancer Using the AWS CLI<a name="as-add-load-balancer-aws-cli"></a>

**To attach a Classic Load Balancer**  
Use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/attach-load-balancers.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/attach-load-balancers.html) command to attach the specified load balancer to your Auto Scaling group:

```
aws autoscaling attach-load-balancers --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --load-balancer-names my-lb
```

**To attach a target group**  
Use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/attach-load-balancer-target-groups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/attach-load-balancer-target-groups.html) command to attach the specified target group to your Auto Scaling group:

```
aws autoscaling attach-load-balancer-target-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --target-group-arns my-targetgroup-arn
```

**To detach a Classic Load Balancer**  
Use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/detach-load-balancers.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/detach-load-balancers.html) command to detach a load balancer from your Auto Scaling group if you no longer need it:

```
aws autoscaling detach-load-balancers --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --load-balancer-names my-lb
```

**To detach a target group**  
Use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/detach-load-balancer-target-groups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/detach-load-balancer-target-groups.html) command to detach a target group from your Auto Scaling group if you no longer need it:

```
aws autoscaling detach-load-balancer-target-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --target-group-arns my-targetgroup-arn
```
